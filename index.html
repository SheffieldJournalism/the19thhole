      <p>The game of golf is undoubtedly a tremendous game of passion, skill and determination that has produced some of the best sporting moments in the past 100 years.  In that time, not only have the best golfers in the game entertained, but they have inspired and encouraged generations of individuals to take up the game. </p>

    </div>

      <p>Although not every amateur can hit a 300yd drive or draw the ball with a 3 iron around a tree from heavy rough like the pros. Many golfers at club level don’t just play the game for its challenging and rewarding nature, but for the social aspect of it too.</p>

  <p>The 19th Hole, the pub or bar after a round, is a place well known to many club members. A place where after a gruelling 4 hours of looking for their ball, a casual golfer can share a drink or two with his playing partners and laugh away the stresses of double bogeys. </p>
  <div class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="3s" data-wow-delay="3s">

  </div>

<p>But the social side isn’t all about alcohol. There are the joys of meeting a number of different folk and building a large network of friends with a common interest. There can be positive relationships developed on business events and fun weekends away from the real world to play golf for numerous days in foreign countries on golfing holidays. The game can offer a sport for someone older or an activity for someone who may dislike the physicality of football or rugby. The relations made can even overlap into general social life, attending dinner dances or team events within the club.</p>

<p>Whichever applies, golf offers a variety of benefits in addition to the sense of satisfaction of birdieing a par 4. This feature will delve into detail on the social benefits of golf, the social differences across cultures and alcohol’s relationship with the game, amongst other aspects. </p>

<p>So, whilst you’re waiting for Tiger to tee off, scroll down and indulge yourself in a quick seven holes on the world of social golf. </p>

      <p>Golf is played by a variety of people from all different walks of life. There are older golfers, younger golfers, high handicappers and low handicappers, but what would you class as the typical golfer? A study carried out by <a href="http://www.golf.com/special-features/2009-survey-american-golfer">Golf.com</a> back in 2009 attempted to find out just who the average golfer is and why it is they play. This is what they found:

So yes, not surprisingly, golf as a sport itself is the main draw to the game. But we can’t ignore the 21% of people who primarily play for the social benefit. And of those who were surveyed, 33% of players said they will have one drink or more in a typical round…and that’s probably not entirely for the purpose of improving your golf?

    <p>As we can see from the reasons above, golf can offer social benefits for those who play as well as keeping fit and enjoying the challenge. However these social benefits can vary from person to person, depending on how involved they are in the club or simply what they enjoy or don’t enjoy.

  Golf also offers a social sport for many older people. It is a sport that can stay with someone for life and players can swing right up until their final days. Even those who may struggle to walk can get around with buggies and other varieties of trolleys. In this way, golf adds to your social life not just for your younger years, but for life. </p>

"Golf and membership of a Golf Club was at one time considered quite elitist. I was
fortunate, I joined Blackburn Golf Club as a junior at age 13. At that time there were strict
rules and regulations in force for all classes of membership but a sense of discipline and
respect for all became second nature. I made friendships that lasted a lifetime.
These days such friendships still apply, and golf also provided useful contacts in my working

      Drinking is a big part of the golfing culture. The 19th hole at a golf club is frequently pumped full of tired golfers after slogging through the previous 18 in all weather conditions. It’s custom to share a drink with your playing partners after a game of golf and to discuss what happened on the course and what is happening in each others' lives off the course. This not only offers a polite and enjoyable end to the round, but can further add to your social circles.
  </p>
    <p>  The relationship between alcohol and golf is said to have its roots in the sort of people that played the earliest version of the game. Golf and alcohol were believed to be two favourite pastimes of those men who were wealthy enough to play the game of golf back in Scotland in the 15th century. Although these days the trend remains somewhat the same. <a href="http://deerlodgegolf.com/">Deer Lodge Golf</a> claims that a large number of men in power enjoy golf and a large number of men in positions of power also are big on drinking.
      </p>

      <p>
      Although in the modern day, golf is much more accessible to the masses and a huge portion of the population are very happy to have a drink or two. It just happens that the relationship between golf and drinking that began in the upper echelons of society has maintained its place in the culture of golf.

<p>With the relationship between drinking and golf, drinking on the course whilst playing has likely been done by most members. Charity days, golfing holidays and casual rounds all have potential to be booze filled experiences and a number of people would argue that they actually play better in these situations. Could it be the so called ’swing oil’ giving a helping hand? </p>

<p> <a href=" https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/health-effects-of-alcohol/lifestyle/can-alcohol-affect-sports-performance-and-fitness-levels/">DrinkAware</a> warn that alcohol can have a negative effect on sports performance for two reasons (click on the text to flip between the two):</p>

<p>One study which was carried out was by Striano, a Titleist performance institute-certified chiropractor, and Melnik, assistant pro at Ardsley Country Club, for <a href="http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/Golf-Guide-2013/Does-Drinking-Beer-Make-You-Better-at-Golf/">Westchester Magazine</a>. A dozen golfers, with varying handicaps, were told to hit golf balls into a net, then drink, then hit some more. This was repeated, a lot, and provided some interesting results. </p>

<p>Considering both studies, it sounds like heavy drinking and playing golf might not reap the best results but you’ll certainly have fun doing it.

<p class="hello">Golf and business are good friends and have been for quite a while. Playing golf with your clients and prospective customers provides a phenomenal way of getting to know each other in an informal setting and can go a long way in advancing friends of your company. <b><a href="https://golfoperatormagazine.com/10-reasons-golf-will-always-be-the-ultimate-business-tool/">Andrew Wood</a></b> in Golf Operator magazine defined ten different reasons (scroll) that golf can benefit your business: </p>
<div class="container4">
<div class="containerbro">


<p><b>1.	FaceTime</b> – allowing four hours with a lot of quiet time to interact with those important people within your business.</p>
<p><b>2.	Serene Surroundings</b> – a relaxed friendly environment goes a long way compared to your generic four white walls. </p>
<p><b>3.	Business Intelligence</b> – learning a lot about people on how they handle themselves on the course.</p>
<p><b>4.	Friendships Forged</b> – relationships built on the course could help provide you with better opportunities.</p>
<p><b>5.	Open Doors on the Road</b> - with travelling, golf is a great way to open doors by letting prospects or business contacts know you are in the area and up for a game. </p>




  <p> <b>6.	Perfect Gifting</b> - when someone is a golfer it’s easy to give a small gift that also makes an impact.</p>
  <p><b>7.	Game for Life</b> - golf suits all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. And thanks to the handicap system, people of widely different abilities can play together and still compete.  </p>
  <p><b>8.	Advantage Women</b> – being a businesswoman who plays golf can help communication with higher level peers. If you can talk about golf, you suddenly have reasons to chat with the CEO. </p>
  <p><b>9.	Networking</b> - showing up at a club to play a game, depending on your business, can mean you’re looking at three prospects each and every time you tee it up.</p>

<p>But don’t just take his word for it. <b>Sean McGrae</b>, 48, is the Senior Manager for National Transport at Tarmac. He’s just one of many businessmen who enjoy using golf to further his relationships and drum up new business. He said: </p>
<div class="Sean">
<div class="seanpanel wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-duration="1s">


<p>“Golf offers huge opportunities to talk whilst taking part and so this means you can actually do business whilst playing. Individuals at different levels within businesses can mix easily as it is not limited by age and to some degree physical limitations."</p>

<p>"The sport is played outside in the fresh air so you are clear to think and discuss business in a relaxed atmosphere. Whilst these days deals are not signed sealed and delivered on the course, the time spent discussing opportunities can often mean time saved in the office."</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="yop wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="3s" data-wow-duration="1s">


<p>"The time on a course also allows relationship building as you have plenty of time to discuss non-business topics and so get to know an individual much better which helps you to understand what makes that person 'tick', what kind of things are important to them as a person, and therefore how best to approach them in the future to get the best out of the relationship in a very much two way approach.”</p>

<p> Golfing trips away with fellow players to experience different courses up and down the country has been common for many years. Although many club members are now partaking in golfing holidays abroad. It’s not hard to see why. The pristine courses, matched with the glorious weather of the USA and many European destinations, are convincing more and more people to jump on a plane with their clubs. </p>

<p><b>Michael Hardman</b>, aged 69, plays off 26 at Blackburn Golf Club but stresses that he played far better in his younger years. He’s been on a number of golfing holidays as a player for over 40 years, mainly in Spain and in recent years, Portugal. He said:</p>

<blockquote class="aah wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-duration="2s">
  “Not only do you enjoy a holiday break but you get to play in a warmer and usually more stable climate. The condition of the courses are also great all year round but particularly in the Autumn months, when we try to avoid the English weather. I always go with a small group of friends of a similar age and outlook but as we have become older, lates night are no longer on the schedule!”
</blockquote>
<p>One reason golfing holidays can be so successful is the number of quality courses within a small area. The map below shows over 15 courses in the Marbella area. The drive time from the two courses furthest out is just under an hour according to Google Maps, giving your party a number of options when you’re out there. </p>

<p>The deals that you can get on golfing holidays aren’t bad either. Golfbreaks.com offers all-inclusive trips from £249 for three nights with two rounds of golf on around twenty different courses in Spain, Portugal and Turkey - five of which include courses on the map above.</p>

  One of the ways in which the social side of golf is enhanced, is through events that are put on at the golf club for all members to attend. These can range from dinner dances to charity events and aim to bring golfers together, whilst raising funds to help support the club. Other examples of social events put on by golf clubs include golfing trips to other courses, themed nights, quiz evenings and night golf.
  </p>
  <p>President <b>Martin Mould</b> attempts to put what he can on at his municipal club, Beauchief GC, but says it’s difficult because of the size of the clubhouse and the support the events recieve:</p>




  <iframe class="wow zoomInDown" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-duration="1s" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbmJTbuebiw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>In recent years, these types of social events have seen a general decline in attendance. Many golfers are either busy with their own plans or live too far away from the place they play, amongst other reasons. </p>

  <div class="billlad">

  <p class="right billy">
  <b>Sir Bill Taylor</b>, 66, is a social member at Blackburn Golf Club and was formerly Mayor of the Lancashire town. He originally joined the golf club after attending a social event there, the Annual Hot Pot Supper, and played golf as a member for over 20 years. He claims that social events seem to be struggling these days:
  </p>
  <b class="right billy">“At first, the social events were enjoyable, but they didn’t keep pace with change - 70s tribute bands aren’t much fun for younger members brought up on more modern music of the 90s & after. My wife enjoyed the social stuff but it got jaded after a time.”</b>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>Sir Taylor’s view on the social events seems to be a fair one, with plenty of other golfers agreeing that something needs to change to help the attendance of these sort of events. Below are a few quotes from other club golfers on what they think:</p>

  <div class="events5">
    <div class="item soceve wow flipInY" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-duration"1s">
      <b>“I attend club events infrequently and feel guilty about this. I need to encourage my group of friends to get involved more.”
  </b>  </div>
    <div class="item soceve wow flipInY" data-wow-delay="1.5s" data-wow-duration"1s">
      <b>“To be totally honest some of these are a real drag, but some are important so we support them. My feeling is that most clubs need to re-address the social side of what they do and stop being so elitist.”</b>

    </div>
    <div class="item soceve wow flipInY" data-wow-delay="2s" data-wow-duration"1s">
    <b>
  “The content of social evenings tends to be a little tired, and outings usually involve a long day with coach travel.”
  </b>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Despite these negative views on social events that clubs can put on, Jamie Storm, assistant in the pro shop at Blackburn GC, reassures that his club isn’t doing too badly: </p>
  <blockquote class="ss7 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s" data-wow-duration="3s">
    <p>“It all boils down to how active is your home club at organising events and to what standard do they execute them? At Blackburn, I’ve been lucky enough to go to a large majority of the social events and 95% of the time, they have been brilliant.
  </p>
  <p>“I’ve said it before but it’s the people that make the outings and events. If you have a club full of outgoing people and people who like a drink, all events end up being a great laugh if nothing else.
  </p>
  <p>“Blackburn Golf Club is in the unique position where it has become many member local pub so to speak. The ale is cheap, it’s always rammed on a weekend and the football/golf is always on, so it’s the perfect place for many people and puts other pubs to shame. On a hot summer Saturday, there is no place better.”
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It seems as though the general feel is that social events need to be readdressed for a more modern society, as well as keeping with traditions. However, if they’re organised well enough and the people make the effort to attend, they’re a great addition to the social side of a golf club and long may they continue.

  <p>Across the past seven holes we've learnt a number of things about the social side of golf. For instance, we now know that playing golf drunk actually isn't as successful as we first thought, we know ten different cheat codes for improving your business via golf, and we've learnt that golf in the USA is just as good as it looks.</p>
  <p>But what's for the future of the social side? Social events may need to be addressed, golfing holidays are becoming more and more popular, and will golf continue to succeed on the business circuit?</p>
  <p>Either way, one thing that seems to be guaranteed is the fact that no matter what reason you're playing golf, where you're playing it, or how many cans you've sunk the night before, it's a game that offers some great social benefits on and off the course and clubhouses will continue to provide a social hub for all levels and ages of golfers. </p>
<p>So next time you're on the 19th hole, raise your pint pot to the game which keeps on giving...golf.</p>
